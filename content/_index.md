        caption="Welcome to my portfolio page! I am a cultural anthropologist specializing in nomadic culture, heritage, and globalization. I care deeply about culture and sustainability as priorities for global development. I believe that ethnography, and the humanities more generally, can have a positive role in shaping our understandings of the present and our visions for the future. The projects highlighted below illustrate some aspects of my professional work."

    caption="My [current research project](Thrift_sustainability-presentation.pdf) explores narratives about ethics and sustainability in global cashmere commodity chains. Although several clothing brands currently advertise *sustainable cashmere* products, there is no shared definition of what actually makes a garment \"sustainable\" or \"ethically-produced\". Unlike global brands, Mongolian herders often describe sustainability in terms of mobility rights, autonomy, and cultural survival."

    caption="The wordcloud above was generated by a simple [python script](https://github.com/DriedFishMatters/zotero-wordcloud) to represent the significant terms in a sample of 1130 publications on dried fish, analyzed as part of a major [literature survey](https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12664) and cataloguing initiative for the [Dried Fish Matters](https://driedfishmatters.org) SSHRC Partnership Grant. As part of this same project I developed a [command-line software tool for bibliographic analysis](https://github.com/DriedFishMatters/zotero-meta-analysis-toolkit) and an [online graphing tool](https://github.com/DriedFishMatters/zoterotags). I describe this initiative in an [extended technical and methodological note](DFM_MEM_ebook-zotero-chapter-final-draft.pdf)."

See our [methodological note](E-book_NW+ET_Dried_fish_stories_Draft02_2022-02.pdf) on this video as an experiment in knowledge co-creation among researchers, and my [commentary](DFM_WRT_taste-and-smell.pdf) on the four stories contained within the video."

    caption="I am the curator of [Digital Mongolia](http://digitalmongolia.org), a digital archive of ethnographic materials related to Mongolia and surrounding areas of Inner Asia. Our focus area includes Mongolia itself, Inner Mongolia, the Buryat and Kalmyk areas of Russia, and ethnically Mongolian areas of Xinjiang and Kirghizstan. By presenting material evidence from ethnographic field research, our overall goal is to highlight the value of anthropological knowledge, methods, and perspectives to the general public, both \"at home\" and in the places in which we work. The archive contains more than 800 items from current and past ethnographic research in Inner Asia."

    caption="Milking and processing dairy products constitute a major part of the everyday practices of Mongolian pastoralists, particularly for women. This [21-minute ethnographic film](dairy_production_mongolia_stab.df-360p-vp9-400k.fdf33bb3-6e9b-483e-92ee-a16bfe66e941.webm) comparatively documents dairying practices among several 12 households in both Gobi (desert) and khangai (forested steppe) regions of Mongolia. The selection of images is intended to show the variety of everyday activities involved in dairying: milking livestock camels, goats, and cattle; feeding livestock; and processing milk into curds and distilled liquor. The associated [viewing guide / ethnographic exhibit](exhibit-dairying.pdf) includes over 250 captioned still images from the video."

    alt="Page from the grade IV Citizenship textbook of Mongolia, showing the text of toig and khoos poems used for communicating with sheep and camels."
    caption="The “camel coaxing ritual” was inscribed in December 2015 on the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding. This ritual (_töl avakhuulakh_, _inge khööslökh_, _ivlekh_) involves using song and music to stimulate affective response in livestock who refuse to allow their offspring to suckle. If the ritual is successful, the mother animal succumbs to tearful emotion and gives selflessly of her milk to her calf, thereby allowing herself to be milked by the herder. Since I have personally been involved in several UNESCO intangible heritage nomination processes in Mongolia (though not with this specific nomination), I take particular interest in this case and in the [anthropological insights we might bring to it](Camel-coaxing.pdf). Coaxing rituals reflect the Mongolian assumption animals are sentient beings capable of emotional response, which can be stimulated by vocalizations, music, and song."

    alt="Close-up from a box of APU brand UHT milk, showing two cows and a Mongolian yurt"
    caption="My [study of Mongolian \"pure milk\"](pure-milk-asian-ethnicity.pdf) looks at some of the ethnic dimensions of milk marketing and online discourse by Mongolian dairy consumers. Mongolia has 12 times as many cows per capita than Canada, but still imports over 6 thousand tonnes of powdered milk per year. This reliance on imported milk is largely due to the difficulty of assimilating “traditionally” produced milk (from mobile pastoralists) into industrial production chains. Specifically, there are challenges in maintaining quality control and production stability when the milk comes from dispersed, small-scale pastoralists who produce milk on a seasonal basis. International food safety standards position industrial milk as “safer” due to tightly controlled processes, but they also create uncertainties for Mongolian consumers, since industrially processed milk incorporating imported milk powder is evidently “artificial”. As I suggest in the article, this creates a kind of malaise since milk has strong cultural connotations of purity–as a product of nature/biology and human-livestock relations–whereas imported food products, and particularly Chinese foods, are widely considered artificial or even poisonous."

    caption="The [Oatmeal Squares Project](http://mcdrc.org/src/oatmeal_squares.git/index.html) is a prototype website I put together a few years ago, as an experiment in intertextuality and digital ethnographic methods. The idea was to look at how we might capture practices from everyday life, using a combination of visual and narrative techniques, in ways that expose the commonalities and differences of these practices as they are experienced by different people at different times. The [kitchens](http://mcdrc.org/src/oatmeal_squares.git/kitchens.html) link shows time-lapse photographs of cooking in three different kitchens."
